# ResourcePack-MultiVersion

This program uses agentdid127's Resource Pack Converter.

It creates a new option for conversion, converting any 1.12 pack to a bunch of newer versions for easy use.



This project could also be used as a future example of modded versions of the Resource Pack Converter. I would like to see people creating their own conversions for modded versions of the game in the future.
